# Law of Noncontradiction

A proposition and its negated version cannot be true under the same circumstances and in the same way.
There are no contradiction.

Therefore, *A* and *not A* is false.

> It is impossible that the same thing belong and not belong to the same thing at the same time and in the same respect.

\- Aristotle, Metaphysics, Book IV, Part 4 (translated by W.D. Ross) [1]
