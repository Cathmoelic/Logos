# Law of Excluded Middle

In accordance with the law of excluded middle or excluded third, for every proposition, either its positive or negative form is true.

For all *A*: *A* or *not A*

Regarding the law of excluded middle, Aristotle wrote:

> But on the other hand there cannot be an intermediate between contradictories, but of one subject we must either affirm or deny any one predicate. This is clear, in the first place, if we define what the true and the false are.
>To say of what is that it is not, or of what is not that it is, is false, while to say of what is that it is, and of what is not that it is not, is true;
>so that he who says of anything that it is, or that it is not, will say either what is true or what is false
