# Law of Identity

For all a: a = a.

Regarding this law, Aristotle wrote:

> First then this at least is obviously true, that the word "be" or "not be" has a definite meaning, so that not everything will be "so and not so".
> Again, if "man" has one meaning, let this be "two-footed animal"; by having one meaning I understand this:—if "man" means "X", then if A is a man "X" will be what "being a man" means for him.
> (It makes no difference even if one were to say a word has several meanings, if only they are limited in number;
> for to each definition there might be assigned a different word.
> For instance, we might say that "man" has not one meaning but several, one of which would have one definition, viz. "two-footed animal", while there might be also several other definitions if only they were limited in number;
> for a peculiar name might be assigned to each of the definitions.
> If, however, they were not limited but one were to say that the word has an infinite number of meanings, obviously reasoning would be impossible;
> for not to have one meaning is to have no meaning, and if words have no meaning our reasoning with one another, and indeed with ourselves, has been annihilated;
> for it is impossible to think of anything if we do not think of one thing; but if this is possible, one name might be assigned to this thing.)

In order to talk and reason about something, we first need to affirm its identity.
Without it, we couldn't talk about anything, since we can only grasp things in our reasoning by referring to them via a previous identity.
We wouldn't be able to form a single sentence, since the syntactic subject refers to one or more things, which implies an identity of this thing/these things.
