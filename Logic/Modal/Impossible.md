# Impossible

A statement that is `impossible` contradicts another statement which is [necessary](./Necessary.md), and therefore cannot be true in any situation or any possible world.

An impossible statement is the negation of a [possible](./Possible.md) statement.

## Examples

Given that the statement `2 + 2 = 4` is a necessarily true statement, it would be impossible for the statement `2 + 2 = 5` to be true.

If it is not impossible that it will rain tomorrow, then it is possible that it will rain tomorrow.
