# Necessary

We assume that `necessary` is a familiar term to anyone speaking the English language.
In order to avoid a circular definition, we thus take "necessary" as our starting point.
if something is the case no matter what possible situation is actual, then that something is necessarily the case.

For example, if it's the case that triangles have three sides no matter what possible situation is actual, then it is necessary that triangles have three sides.

Since modal logic makes statements about the objective world, these statements must either be objectively true or objective false.
Hence, the notion of 'necessity' here is objective necessity: necessary things are that way by nature - no matter what anyone may or may not know.
For example, it is necessary that certain axioms entail that there is an infinite amount of prime numbers, whether or not we happen to know this.
It is true even if some people or even all people do not know this.
