# Propositional Calculus

Propositional calculus is a branch of logic. 
It is also called propositional logic, statement logic, sentential calculus, sentential logic, or sometimes zeroth-order logic.
It deals with [propositions](../Proposition.md) (which can be true or false) and argument flow.
Compound propositions are formed by connecting propositions by logical connectives.
The propositions without logical connectives are called atomic propositions.

Unlike first-order logic, propositional logic does not deal with non-logical objects, predicates about them, or quantifiers.
However, all the machinery of propositional logic is included in first-order logic and higher-order logics.
In this sense, propositional logic is the foundation of first-order logic and higher-order logic.
