# Knowing Truth

When we discuss statements, we ought to ask ourselves if it is even possible to know if a staement is true or not.
Secondly we may ask if we can formulate a statement that captures our thought in a sufficient way.

To show that we can do this we need to show a statement that sufficiently captures our thought
and then show that we can really make a judgement about whether it is true or not.

## Argument

1. True statements cannot be known.
2. You know (1).
3. (1) is false.
4. Therefore true statements can be known.

## Further conclusions

1. Is truth [objective](./ObjectiveTruth.md).
