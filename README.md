# Logos

This is a project to argue about logic, epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy, ethics and theology.

## Usage of characters

We chose not to include special characters for the moment.
All documents use ASCII, the American Standard Code for Information Interchange, which means they use the 128 you already know.
We think it is easier to read and understand our arguments when they are written in English.
